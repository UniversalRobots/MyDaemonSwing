# MyDaemonSwing
URCap sample that mainly demonstrates the principle of DaemonContribution and DaemonService.

My Daemon Swing is an extension to the Hello World Swing URCap and demonstrates how a Python 2.5 or C++ daemon can be integrated with the URCap Software Platform. This is useful when a URCap depends on e.g. a driver or server which is not implemented in  Java. Furthermore, the URCap shows how the XML-RPC protocol can be used to communicate with the daemon from an installation node and in the script code generated by a program node.

Information:
* Available from:
  * URCap API version 1.3.0.
